#  **Retention Effects of Level Gating in Cookie Cats**

This repository contains an analysis of an A/B test run on the mobile game **Cookie Cats**, focused on understanding how the placement of the first gate (at level 30 vs. level 40) affects user retention.

üß™ Background

In Cookie Cats, players progress through levels, occasionally encountering gates that pause progress unless certain actions are taken (e.g., in-app purchases or social sharing). This experiment tests whether moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 leads to higher user engagement, measured by short-term and long-term retention.

üîç Metrics Analyzed

1-Day Retention (retention_1) ‚Äî Whether a user returned one day after install

7-Day Retention (retention_7) ‚Äî Whether a user returned seven days after install

Total Game Rounds Played (sum_gamerounds) ‚Äî Proxy for engagement

üßº Data Cleaning

Verified no missing values

Removed extreme outliers based on abnormally high sum_gamerounds

Filtered out users unlikely to have reached level 30 (based on total rounds played)

üë• Group Sizes After Filtering
Gate 30: 44,254 users

Gate 40: 45,037 users

üìà Retention Rates (Filtered Dataset)

1-Day Retention

Gate 30: 79.63%

Gate 40: 79.69%

7-Day Retention

Gate 30: 19.02%

Gate 40: 18.20%

üìê Hypothesis Testing

1-Day Retention
Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): No difference in 1-day retention between gate_30 and gate_40

Result:

Chi-square p-value: 0.9007

Bootstrap 95% CI: [‚àí0.82%, +0.95%]

Treatment effect: +0.06 percentage points

Conclusion:
The result is not statistically significant. We fail to reject H‚ÇÄ.
Gate 40 does not improve short-term retention.

7-Day Retention
Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): No difference in 7-day retention between gate_30 and gate_40

Result:

Chi-square p-value: 0.0012

Bootstrap 95% CI: [‚àí2.04%, +0.13%]

Treatment effect: ‚àí0.82 percentage points

Conclusion:

The p-value suggests a statistically significant difference, and we reject H‚ÇÄ.
However, the confidence interval includes 0, so the result is not robust across methods.
The data suggests gate_40 may reduce long-term retention.

üéØ SRM Check

Chi¬≤ = 0.07, p = 0.7854 ‚Üí No evidence of sample ratio mismatch.

üìà Visualizations

Boxplots of game rounds (before and after cleaning)

Bar charts showing 1-day and 7-day retention by gate version

Comparison charts for visualizing retention differences

‚úÖ Final Recommendation

Keep the gate at level 30.

No meaningful improvement in 1-day retention

Possible negative effect on 7-day retention

No strong statistical or business case for moving the gate

# **Effectiveness of Promotional Strategies in Fast Food Marketing**

This project analyzes an A/B test conducted by a fast food chain to evaluate three promotional strategies (Promotions 1, 2, and 3) and their impact on weekly sales across different store segments.

üß™ Background

The company tested 3 promotions across stores of varying market sizes and store ages, aiming to identify which promotion boosts sales the most and whether effectiveness depends on store characteristics.

README.md ‚Äì Project summary

üìê Hypotheses 

Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):
There is no significant difference in average weekly sales between the different promotion types.

Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):
At least one promotion type leads to significantly different average weekly sales compared to the others.

üìâ Metrics Analyzed

Weekly Sales (SalesInThousands)

Grouped comparisons by:

Promotion Type

Store Age Group: Young (‚â§5), Mid (6‚Äì10), Old (>10)

Market Size: Small, Medium, Large

üßº Data Preparation

Verified data integrity (no missing or malformed entries)

Renamed columns for clarity and readability

Created age and market group labels for segmentation

üîç Key Insights

Promotion 1 consistently delivers the highest weekly sales

Promotion 3 performs better in older stores and smaller markets

Promotion 2 underperforms in all tested conditions

üìà Statistical Tests Used

Test	Purpose	Parametric
ANOVA	Tests if mean sales differ across groups	‚úÖ Yes
Kruskal-Wallis	Non-parametric version of ANOVA (used when data is not normal)	‚ùå No
Tukey HSD	Post-hoc test to identify which pairs differ after ANOVA	‚úÖ Yes
Mann-Whitney U	Non-parametric pairwise test for two groups	‚ùå No
SRM Check (Chi¬≤)	Ensures sample distribution is balanced across groups	‚úÖ Yes
Shapiro-Wilk Test	Checks for normality in sales distributions	‚úÖ Yes

üìä Visuals & Dashboard

Violin, box, and point plots for promotion effectiveness

Correlation heatmaps between numeric features

Segmented plots by Market Size and Store Age

‚úÖ Final Recommendation

Use Promotion 1 as the default strategy

Consider Promotion 3 for older stores and small markets

Phase out Promotion 2 due to underperformance

Customize future campaigns based on store and market context for better ROI
